# Marvel Comics API app

## About The Project

Built with TypeScript + NextJS and hosted with Vercel, this project fetches data from the Marvel API and lets you browse Marvel’s catalogue of comic books. 
Save your favorites with Local Storage, filter the results by character or creator, and view front covers in full screen.

This was originally a company training project. Not only did we have a tight deadline to get all the required functionality while also juggling client-work, but the finished project also had to match the designs provided perfectly. I finished early and even added the full-screen view feature.
